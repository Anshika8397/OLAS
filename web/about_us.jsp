<p> Initailly when a student is admitted to the Banasthali she gets a unique smart card Id which will be used by the parents for initial registration to this system.Similarly each and every member of university have their unique smart card number so ther can use that number to sign up like the HODs of various department,Wardens of various hostels and the Verifying officer.
The step wise process will be initiated by the parent's and will complete at warden's end when she grants permission from the hostel to.The departmental HODs will grant the leave to student of their department and Verifying officers will verify the leave and also checks the number of remaining leaves of students from the pre-existing database.The system also considers the special case of leave in which even if the number of leaves taken by any student exceeds 10 then also HOD will consider it if its urgent need.Finally,a confirmation will be communicated to parents
when the leave is granted.</p>
                <p>At last,we the developers hope to provide the best possible way from our end to provide ease to parents,students,and management as a whole.</p>
